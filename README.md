# Introduction
The following is an in class assignment of a short list of simple problems to be solved using the python programming language, for module Emerging technologies. 

## Getting started

To be able to run these scripts we have a bit of setup to do first. Firstly we will need to have python installed you can get it here:

[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Once the download & installation of Python is finished we are ready to go!

Open a CMD / Terminal window on your system and type in the following:

```cd path/to/directory```

Once in the project directory we will use the following command to run the a script

```python filename.py```

Note you will need to replace filename with the name of the file you want to run.

# pythonFundamentals

## 1. Hello, world!

Write a program that prints "Hello, world!" to the screen.

To run this we enter the following:

```python pythonFundamentals.py```

## 2. Current time

Write a program that prints the current time and date to the console.

To run this we enter the following:

```python pythonFundamentals.py```

## 3. FizzBuzz

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, except for the following conditions. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

To run this we enter the following:

```python fizzBuzz.py```

## 4. Factorial digit sum

Write a function that calculates the sum of the digits of the factorial of a number. n! means n x (n − 1) ... x 3 x 2 x 1. For example, 10! = 10 x 9 x ... x 3 x 2 x 1 = 3628800, and the sum of the digits in the number 10! is 3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27. Find the sum of the digits in the number 100!

To run this we enter the following:

```python factorialDigitSum.py```

## 5. Guessing game

Write a guessing game where the user must guess a secret number. After every guess the program tells the user whether their number was too large or too small. At the end the number of tries needed should be printed. It counts only as one try if they input the same number multiple times consecutively.

To run this we enter the following:

```python guessingGame.py```


## 6. Largest and smallest in list

Source: https://adriann.github.io/programming_problems.html

Write a function that returns the largest and smallest elements in a list.

To run this we enter the following:

```python largestSmallestInList.py```


## 7. Palindrome test

Source: https://adriann.github.io/programming_problems.html

Write a function that tests whether a string is a palindrome.

To run this we enter the following:

```python palindromeTest.py```


## 8. Merge list and sort

Source: https://adriann.github.io/programming_problems.html

Write a function that merges two sorted lists into a new sorted list. [1,4,6],[2,3,5] → [1,2,3,4,5,6].

To run this we enter the following:

```python mergeSortLists.py```


## 9. Newton's method for square roots

Source: https://tour.golang.org/flowcontrol/8

Implement the square root function using Newton's method. In this case, Newton's method is to approximate sqrt(x) by picking a starting point z and then repeating:

z_next = z - ((z*z - x) / (2 * z))

To begin with, just repeat that calculation 10 times and see how close you get to the answer for various values (1, 2, 3, ...). Next, change the loop condition to stop once the value has stopped changing (or only changes by a very small delta). How close are you to the math.sqrt value?

To run this we enter the following:

```python squareRoots.py```

## 10. Reverse string

Write a function to reverse a string

To run this we enter the following:

```python reverseString.py```
